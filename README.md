# Stratos.

Trying to build a compiler and an interpretter.

The language priorities are fast and fun to write.

The tutorial is in cSharp ðŸ’“   Quickly prototype ideas in Kotlin.
The language in written in C or C ++ðŸ’ž.

hopefully one day Stratos will be built in stratos.(dogfeeding)

There are few basics which have not been concluded.
1) Will use gcc or clang(llvm yes.).
     --> (After some  research llvm does seem so appealing, this is highly probable the path that will be taken)
     
2) Whether it will be  vm(Virtual Machine) based language .
     --> (if llvm then compile to native).

3)  A source to source compiler .(typescript  am looking at you ðŸ˜€ ).
     --> (if llvm then compile to native).

This project intends to  enable its creators make mistakes and learn from them ðŸ˜˜.

I am not for the use of `ANTLR` ,`YACC`, `BISON`.

The langauge aims to be pragmatic,use in industries .Correctnes or

## Status.
This project requires my full concetration us such i have decided to clear my  projects list.Hopefully at the end of 2020 or Or Start of 2021 will embark on it.
You can join me in the project then.
ðŸ’“ðŸ’“ðŸ’“.
In the mean time you can join me in reading this.

### Workplan .
This is a wip (work in progress).
* Designing the language.(The basics are done)  check out
     [design.md ](stratos/design/design.md) {`location /stratos/design/design.md`}
     [compiler_design_thoughts.md ](stratos/design/compiler_design_thoughts.md) {`location /stratos/design/compiler_design_thoughts.md`}
* Writing a Parser and a Lexer. (starting off)
* Sematic and syntax analysis (coming soon).
* Human Intermediate Representation (HIR) (We will get there soon )


### Language basic
compile to binary or genrate bytecode to run in an intergpreter
File extensions are `.st` or `.sts`<br>
* `.st` files are for compilation
* `.sts` files are for intrepration



however passed in compiler arguments overide the file extension type inference. 

### Design
* check the  [design.md ](stratos/design/design.md) {`location /stratos/design/design.md`} file for the language design.

* [compiler_design_thoughts.md ](stratos/design/compiler_design_thoughts.md) {`location /stratos/design/compiler_design_thoughts.md`} file for compiler design thoughts.

* [standard_library_thoughts.md ](stratos/design/compiler_design_thoughts.md) {`location /stratos/design/standard_library_thoughts.md`} file for the standard library design thoughts.

* [tooling.md ](stratos/tooling/tooling.md) {`location /stratos/tooling/tooling.md`} file for the standard library design thoughts.

<br>

### Tooling
tooling there will be a cli tool called `toolman` thats the package manager.
(inspired by go in golang and cargo in rust). To get packages build and run the language

packages can be stored in github or gitlab.

*   to get packages just run 
`toolman get git@my-stratos-package`
*   to build the project run (in project directory)
`toolman build`
*   to build the project run (in project directory)
`toolman run`
*   to create a project run `toolman create  project_name` 

### Projects directory
projects can be located anywhere.
the project has
1. `.ini` file describing the project , project name, dependancies and verisons.
2. a `src` folder with `main.st` with hello world boiler plate code ie :

    `use System;` <br> 
    `fn main (){` <br> 
    &emsp; `print("hello world");` <br>
    `}` 

   To know more read the `stratos/design/design.md` file for the language design.
