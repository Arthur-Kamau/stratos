## Built-in functions

* print
* map, filter, reduce
* split, starts_with, ends_with
* read_file, write_file
* http_request

## Checker Responsibilities

* both funs and procs:
    * correct number of call arguments to callables
    * referenced variables are defined
    * show warning for unused variables
* funs only:
    * no re-assignment of variables
    * no indexed assignments
    * no loops
    * no calls to non-funs
    * one return statement in each possible branch
* loose funs:
    * can only mutate values that were initialized within the function
    * no calls to non-funs
* type checking - (at a later future point)
