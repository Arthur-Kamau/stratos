Table of contents
==================


This repository contains the tooling, compiler, language design notes, sample & examples of the stratos programming  language.
Each subsection has `README.md` or `*.md` files  going a level deeper into discussing the subseection.

Folder breakdown 

* `Stratos.md` -> More Highlevel overview of the language, file extenstion, config file type, comipiler commands and tooling. A great place to get started if interested in the project as a whole.
* `Comipler` -> The stratos compiler.
* `design` -> this can be split into three
    1. compiler -> This are design decisions implemented or discarded when implementing the compiler.
    2. language ->  this is the language semantics and syntax.
    3. library -> The design of the Stratos Standard Library. 
* `sample` ->   Stratos project showing the basic file structure of a stratos project, can be used as a template
* `example` -> Stratos Sample project used to test various language features such as functions, data types.

* `icons` -> Project icons.
* `docs` -> user facing documentation.
* `tooling` -> Intellij Language plugin, vs Code Language plugin, Toolman(see `Stratos.md` )
