# Standard Library (Sdl)

From observation a well designed, comprehensive standard library increases programmers productivity.
Unlike Go, Stratos will have a more thorough standard library.
The use of Namespaces will be heavily use.

Remeber the use `import` and `use` check out design.md.
TLDR ; Import is for a class while use is for a namespace.





This following will most likely change.
Exmple 
`namespace system` will contain.

1. ValueType.
2. IO
3. File 


`namespace linq`
