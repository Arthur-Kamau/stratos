# Data types

### Basic Data tpes.
The basic data types include `int` , `string` , `double` , `char` , `number`, `Optional`, `some`, `none`, `unit`.<br>
`Some` is used to indicate a value inside an `Optional`<br>
`None` is used to indicate the absence of a value inside an `Optional`<br>

### Extended data types.
The basic types could be extended to have  extended data types that can be used for specialised scenarios or when the programmer wants to micro manage the inference type system example `uint32` for unsigned integer with maximum capacity of 32 bits <br>

### Complex data types.
More complex data types like `map`, `tuple`, `array`,`list` and `set`, are generic (based on any of the basic data types)
