# Data types

### Basic Data tpes.
The basic data types include `int` , `string` , `double` , `char` , `number`, `some`, `none`, `unit`.<br>
some is used to indicate something, an object<br>

### Extended data types.
The basic types could be extended to have  etended data types that can be used for specialised scenaries or when  the programmer wants to micro manage the inference type system example `uint32` for unsingned integer with maximum capacity of 32 bits <br>

### Complex data types.
More complex data types like `map`, `tuple`, `array`,`list` and `set`, are generic(based on any of the basic data tpes)
