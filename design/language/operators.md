## Comparison operators
`==`, `!=` , `>=` , `<=` , `<>`,  `<=>` ,`<!>`, `<!=>` <br>
* `==` equality operator
* `!=` not equal operator
* `>=` greater than or equal operator
* `<=` less than or equal operator
* `<>` range between the left and and right hand (exclusive)
* `<=>` range between the left and and right hand (inclusive)
* `<!=>`  not between range


### Logical operators
`&&` , `||`,  `not` ,`~`, `|` , `&` ,`!`
* `&&`  logical and
* `||`  logical or
* `not`  and `!` logical not 
* `~`  bit wise not
* `|`  bit wise or
* `&`  bit wise and

### Arthmetic oprators
`+` , `-`, `/` , `*`, `mod` or `%`

* `+` - addition.
* `-` - subtraction.
* `/` - division.
* `*` - mutliply (compound).
* `mod` or `%` - remainder of (modulus).

`+=`, `++`, `--` , `*=` `/=` 
* `+=` -  incrementing the variable on the left by an arbitrary value on the right
* `++` - plus one
* `--` - minus one
* `*=`compund the variable on the left by an arbitrary value on the right
* `/=`divide the variable on the left by an arbitrary value on the right
